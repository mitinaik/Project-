// This program askes the users to enter the discount rate of an item then it calls the superclass and subbclass, gives the output message by using iniheritaance. 
// Then this program askes users to enter the name of the file using the printerwriter and scanner method. This program then inputs the following information 
// in to the file, then the program outputs the file with the Number of months, The totalsales, and the average sales of this program.
// This specific program need a null file then it inputs the information in to the null file. This program has a two abstract method within the interface. 
// The abstract method specifies the type of the store, and item sold in the stotre. This program also has a overriding and overloading methods.
// This program also uses polymorphism to call the methods. 
// This program also haas loop if the file is not null.
//This program try and cathces method if the file was not found or error.
// This program askes the user of amount of the totalsales for the store.
// This program then askes the user of number of customer by asking the sales of customer.
//This program then computes the average sales and output the result in to the name of the file given.
